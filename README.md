# 📈 Time Series Forecasting Project

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on **time series forecasting**, aiming to predict future values based on historical data using statistical and machine learning models.

## 🧠 Methodology
The notebook explores data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and forecasting. Typical models include:
- ARIMA / SARIMA
- Prophet
- LSTM / RNN-based models
- Moving averages and smoothing methods

## 📊 Visualizations
Below are visualizations generated from the notebook:
